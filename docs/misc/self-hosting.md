# Self-Hosting

## Requirements

1. [Node.js v15](https://nodejs.org/) or newer.
2. A [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) or [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) database.

## Setup

1. Copy example config files.
    * Navigate to the `config` folder of this project.
    * Copy all files ending in `.example.json` and remove the `.example` from the copied file names.
        * Ex: `config.example.json` should be copied and renamed as `config.json`.
2. Obtain a bot token.
    * You'll need to create a new bot in your [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications/).
        * See [here](https://www.writebots.com/discord-bot-token/) for detailed instructions.
        * At the end you should have a **bot token**.
3. Modify the config file.
    * Open the `config/config.json` file.
    * You'll need to edit the following values:
        * `client.id` - Your discord bot's [user ID](https://techswift.org/2020/04/22/how-to-find-your-user-id-on-discord/).
        * `client.token` - Your discord bot's token.
        * `database.host`- The ip address that your database is running on \(or `localhost`\)
        * `database.database` - The name of the database to use.
        * `database.username` - The username to use when accessing the database.
        * `database.password` - The password of the user accessing the database.
4. Install packages.
    * Navigate into the downloaded source files and type `npm install`.
5. Register commands.
    * In order to use slash commands, they first [have to be registered](https://discordjs.guide/interactions/registering-slash-commands.html#registering-slash-commands).
    * Type `npm run register` to register the bot's commands.
        * Run this script any time you change a command name, structure, or add/remove commands.
        * This is so Discord knows what your commands look like.
        * It may take up to an hour for command changes to appear.

## Running

You can run Friend Time in 4 different modes:

1. Normal Mode
    * Type `npm start`.
    * This runs the bot directly with Node and without shards.
    * Use this mode if you don't need sharding.
2. Dev Mode
    * Type `npm start:dev`.
    * This runs the bot with [ts-node-dev](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node-dev).
    * Use this mode for general development.
    * TypeScript files are compiled automatically as they are changed.
3. Shard Mode
    * Type `npm run start:shard`.
    * This runs the bot directly with Node and with sharding enabled.
    * Use this mode if you need sharding.
4. PM2 Mode
    * Run by typing `npm run start:pm2`.
    * This runs the bot using the process manager [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/).
    * Use this mode if you require the bot to always be online.
