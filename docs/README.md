## Introduction

If you have a discord server with users across multiple countries and time zones then this is the bot for you! With Friend Time you can easily coordinate times between users.

Friend Time will automatically react with a clock emoji \(🕰️\) to times mentioned in chat:

By also reacting, you will be private messaged with the time converted to your time zone:
